# Implementation-of-Flappy-Bird-using-Reinforcement-Learning

This is an implementation of the famous game Flappy bird using Reinforcement Learning using tensorflow and Pytorch.

This sample is published as part of the corresponding blog article at https://www.toptal.com/deep-learning/pytorch-reinforcement-learning-tutorial
##### Dependencies:
* Python 3.6.5
* Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

##### How to run:
* Run `python dqn.py test` to run pretrained neural network model.
* Run `python dqn.py train` to train the model from the beginning. You can also increase FPS in game/flappy_bird.py script for faster training.
